# Project Write-Up
## Avoiding heat-illness in New York City's busiest and hottest MTA stations


### Abstract

The goal of this project was to (1) determine the MTA stations that pose the greatest hazard&mdash;due to the combination of high heat and large crowds&mdash;to people at high-risk for heat-related illnesses, and to (2) the general public with access to this information, so that people a high-risk for heat-illness (e.g., adults over the age of 65, people with existing health conditions) can make more informed decisions about which MTA stations to avoid to maintain their personal health. I compared [subway turnstile data](http://web.mta.info/developers/turnstile.html) provided by the MTA with corresponding surface temperature data collected by the [NASA Landsat 8 satellite](https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/) to create a heat-illness risk index for subway stations in the MTA system. After determining the highest heat-illness risk stations, I built an interactive Tableau dashboard to visualize and publicize these results.
