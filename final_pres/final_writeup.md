# Avoiding heat-illness in New York City's busiest and hottest MTA stations

### Abstract

The goal of this project was to determine the MTA stations that pose the greatest hazard&mdash;due to the combination of high heat and large crowds&mdash;to people at high-risk for heat-related illnesses, and to provide access to the general public to this information, so that people in high-risk groups () can make more informed decisions about which MTA stations to avoid to maintain their personal health.
