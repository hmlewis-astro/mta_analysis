# Project Proposal
## New York City transit data [NEED A CATCHY TITLE HERE]

Heat stress and heat-related illnesses occur when the body is unable to cool itself and maintain a healthy temperature, and begins to overheat. Heat illness symptoms can range from mild (e.g., a rash or muscle spasms) to severe (e.g., heatstroke), and can kill.

Although anyone can suffer from heat-related illness, adults over the age of 65, infants and young children, and people with existing health conditions (such asthma, COPD, heart disease, or high blood pressure) are at greater risk than others.

Heat stress can be exacerbated by conditions that are excessively hot and extremely crowded.

### Question:

For an upcoming press release concerning summer heat, the New York City Department of Health and Mental Illness wants to compile a list of MTA stations that pose the greatest hazard to people at high-risk for heat-related illnesses.

### Data description:

The [urban heat island effect](https://scied.ucar.edu/learning-zone/climate-change-impacts/urban-heat-islands)---that cities tend to be hotter than their natural surroundings---is a well studied phenomenon; however, it has also been shown that *within* cities temperatures vary by up to 10s of degrees due to variation in tree cover and impervious ground (i.e., pavement/blacktop) cover.

To determine those MTA stations that pose the greatest risk due to extreme heat, we will utilize thermal imagery of New York City captured during summer months (June, July, or August) from the NASA Landsat 8 satellite. From these images, surface temperatures can be extracted with 10 square meter resolution such that stations can be ranked by a heat index.

The New York MTA publishes weekly turnstile data that provides ridership as measured by turnstile entries and exits, with readings taken every 4 hours, and [data publicly available](http://web.mta.info/developers/turnstile.html) going back to 2010.
